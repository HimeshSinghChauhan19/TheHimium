# Personal Portfolio Website

## Tech Stack Used:-
React Js, JavaScript, Scss, HTML.
## Aim of this?
Basically I wanted to create something as a practice for the React Js knowledge that I had gained and I came up with this. 
## Anything Interesting?
I have used React States to give the website a quick navigation functionality and also used React props to pass data between the components. 
Kept the file structure really simple and succint, separate folder for Scss files, for pages and for components and integrating them at last to pass them to the final index files.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to the sources that made this possible, the inspirations, the helpers and the documentions that helped in confusions.
